Now that the bounding box is show at the right frame and timing, please similarly fix the "Pose Overlay" which has the wrong scale and at the wrong place of a frame: think deeper on how to fix these issues robustly and completely both for the UI/UX at the frontend as well as the right endpoints and parameters needed at the `server`.  Identify the root causes first before proposing fixes.  Test your implementation thoroughly with pytests & property-based tests & integration tests.  Finally fix all uncovered issues and warnings completely and holistically.
