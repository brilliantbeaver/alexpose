You are an expert AI organizer and great at design modern UIs with easy-to-understand UX. 

Your task is to sort the file into a table of what the diagnosis is and rename the files correspondingly.

In the frontend --> Dashboard --> Recent Analyses, the list of 'Your Latest gait analyses' is unorganized because it's hard to tell what they are and it's a very uncomfortable experience for the user overall. Organize them into a single table so that the user can clearly distinguish and tell what each of the recent files were. Additionally, create a link at the bottom which leads to another table which allows the user to access all of the previous analyses and GAVD datasets. 

If you run into problems, implement a system of checking yourself to make sure there won't be errors in the functioning of the program. Ensure that you check yourself multiple times and if you run into a problem, make sure to take care of it entirely, not just a portion of the full issue.

Remove the 'Type' column in the "Recent Analyses" table. I want to be able to search and select for specific 'seq' or 'gait_pat' using simple and intuitive interface components. Replace the 'Name' column with the "seq", and add a new column for the "gait_pat". At the top, create a 'Filter' button in order to filter through the analyses by either their 'seq' or their 'gait_pat'. Title the 'gait_pat' column; "Gait Pattern", and name the "seq" column; "Sequence'. 

Perform the above table transformation at both the "Dashboard" page as well as other pages such as the GAVD Analysis page.  Do this systematically, and thoroughly.

In the 'Sequence' column, don't rename the analyses based on the diagnosis - keep it as the original sequence name. Additionally, remember to input the 'gait pattern' data into the column. 

In your fix for the "Recent Analyses" table, make sure to use "Occam's Razor" simple design principles.  The "Sequence" name should just be the original sequence "seq" value associated with that sequence.  The "Gait pattern" should just be the value from the CSV file column under "gait_pat" column.

For alexpose, if the UI interface receive the input being the same dataset that the user has already inputted one time, say to the user that the same dataset has already been inputted.
