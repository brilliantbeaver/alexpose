## Phase 3

Systematically and persistently continue to complete all of the tasks in Phase 3 and completely check off all of these Acceptance Criteria in #Current File.  Be persistent, diligent, and holistic in your approach.  After finishing each section, make sure to double check that the Acceptance Criteria are fully satisfied also.   Do not return until you have successfully completed all of the tasks and acceptance criteria for this Phase.

For each of the task, make sure to write comprehensive pytests, property-based tests, and integration tests to provide as much code coverage as possible.  These tests must be in the toplevel `tests` folder and in the appropriate package subfolders.  Avoid creating unnecessary mocks and use Occam's Razor principles in your test designs.  Run all of your tests and fully understand the root causes for any failures or warnings.  Thoroughly investigate how to fix these issues and execute the fixes carefully and systematically.

Your implementation must confirm to the design in #design.md  and the requirements in #requirements.md .  Proceed systematically and persistently until you finish all of your tasks.
