Use best OOP software engineer practices, SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, modularity, robustness and extensibility to refactor the hard evidences in _generate_evidence_based_recommendations of   out to a yaml config file in the `config` folder.  You will need to design the right data structure and metadata to make this mechanism generic for specifying different type of "evidence" and "capabilities" that can be (dependency) injected into other additional recommendations for different types of abnormalities and gait patterns.

Think deeply and thoughtfulll on how best to design and implement these requirements.  Also write thorough pytests, property-based tests and integration tests in `tests` folders to make sure correctness of implementations.  Document your design thoroughly in "docs/evidence" with well structured markdown, mermaid diagrams.
