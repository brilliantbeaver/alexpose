You are an expert processor of CSV files.

Your task is to create different "gait_pat" csv files based on "GAVD_Clinical_Annotations_1.csv" in the toplevel "data" folder.

The first row represents the column names for the rest of the file.

For each row of "CSV", the first value is the sequence "seq" identifier.  The 2nd value is the frame number ("frame_num") of that sequence's video.

The column "gait_pat" is the gait pattern that we would like to create subfolders of.  In the data folder, create a subfolder called "gavd".  Inside that gavd folder, create subfolders of unique names based on the value of unique "gait_pat" names.

There's multiple frames for the same "seq" across multiple consecutive rows. 

Save rows with the same "seq" in "GAVD_Clinical_Annotations_1.csv" into different csv files of names represented by the "seq" value in the subfolder of name represented in the "gait_pat".  Each of these CSV files in the subfolder should have the same first column name rows as that in the "GAVD_Clinical_Annotations_1.csv" file.

If you run into problems, implement a system of checking yourself to make sure there won't be errors in the functioning of the program. Ensure that you check yourself multiple times and if you run into a problem, make sure to take care of it entirely, not just a portion of the full issue.
